Improved TRIK external simulation tool. Base taken from https://gist.github.com/anastasiia-kornilova/2b955e62c3cef7a509fc043a189ea3ff and https://gist.github.com/anastasiia-kornilova/f13a708562debabeeb126381f3d535e5
First argument is path to directory with program, second argument is relative path to program, third argument is relative path to fields directory, fourth argument is full path to TRIK studio installation directory.
Probably only works in XML mode.
Untested on linux, probably doesn't work on it.
